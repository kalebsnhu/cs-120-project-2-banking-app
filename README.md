# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is a banking application that you can input values and it will print you a spreadsheet with the data provided. It will display your yearly interest and year-end balance.

# What did you do particularly well?
I created a program that completely does as intended. You can input values and it will give you a detailed breakdown of yearly interest and year-end balance. When making the program I made utility functions that were used throughout the project. After you print the first detailed breakdown of your inserted values you can edit individual values to see what each change will do.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
If I had to remake the program, I would make it so it’s more intelligent. I would do it so you can choose between yearly or monthly breakdowns or both, that way you can get the in-depth information you may need. I believe the code is as efficient as it could be at this moment in time. I’m sure the more I code the better my code will become.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was the monthly interest, I was having issues where the values were not outputting the correct value as described in the project information. I had to spend a lot of time trying to do the calculations correctly. The object-oriented part of the project was also challenging, I tried to make everything tied into the object (BankingApp).

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills I have learned throughout the project are integrating an object into an application. Learning more in-depth object-oriented programming skills are the best things you can transfer. There are a lot of object-oriented programming languages that you can learn one skill on one and transfer it to another.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program is readable because the code utilizes clean and readable variables naming. Naming variables correctly is the best way you can go back in your code and know exactly what the variable is. The function names are also readable, which helps the programmer add and delete features.
